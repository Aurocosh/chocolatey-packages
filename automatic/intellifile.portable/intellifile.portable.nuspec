## Introduction

_IntelliFile_ is a free (as in “free speech” and also as in “free beer”) file manager. Running in the Microsoft Windows environment, its use is governed by [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html). _IntelliFile_ is written in C++ and uses pure Win32 API and STL which ensures a higher execution speed and smaller program size. By optimizing as many routines as possible without losing user friendliness, _IntelliFile_ is trying to reduce the world carbon dioxide emissions. When using less CPU power, the PC can throttle down and reduce power consumption, resulting in a greener environment. I hope you enjoy _IntelliFile_ as much as I enjoy coding it!
