    <summary>Video stabilization using gyroscope data</summary>
    <description>## About the project
Gyroflow is an application that can stabilize your video by using motion data from a gyroscope and optionally an accelerometer. Modern cameras record that data internally (GoPro, Sony, Insta360 etc), and this application stabilizes the captured footage precisely by using them. It can also use gyro data from an external source (eg. from Betaflight blackbox).

## Features
- Real-time preview, parameter adjustments and all calculations
- GPU processing and rendering, all algorithms fully multi-threaded
- Rolling shutter correction
- [Video editor plugins](https://github.com/gyroflow/gyroflow-plugins) (Adobe Premiere/Ae, DaVinci Resolve, Final Cut Pro and more), allowing you to apply stabilization directly in a video editor without transcoding
- Supports full Sony metadata (recording params, automatic lens, support for IBIS, OIS, EIS - you can have IBIS enabled in camera and still apply Gyroflow on top)
- Supports already stabilized GoPro videos (captured with Hypersmooth enabled) (Hero 8 and up)
- Supports and renders 10-bit videos (up to 16-bit 4:4:4:4 for regular codecs and 32-bit float for OpenEXR - working directly on YUV data to maintain maximum quality)
- Customizable lens correction strength
- Render queue
- Keyframes
- Ability to create custom settings presets
- Visual chart with gyro data (displays gyro, accelerometer, magnetometer, and quaternions, including smoothed quaternions)
- Supports underwater footage (corrects underwater distortions)
- Modern responsive user interface with Dark and Light theme
- Adaptive zoom (dynamic cropping)
- Zoom limit
- Supports image sequences (PNG, OpenEXR, CinemaDNG)
- Based on [telemetry-parser](https://github.com/AdrianEddy/telemetry-parser) - supports all gyro sources out of the box
- Gyro low pass filter, arbitrary rotation (pitch, roll, yaw angles) and orientation
- Multiple gyro integration methods for orientation determination
- Multiple video orientation smoothing algorithms, including horizon levelling and per-axis smoothness adjustment.
- Cross-platform - works on Windows/Linux/Mac/Android/iOS
- Multiple UI languages
- Supports variable and high frame rate videos - all calculations are done on timestamps
- H.264/AVC, H.265/HEVC, ProRes, DNxHD, CineForm, PNG and OpenEXR outputs, with H.264 and H.265 fully GPU accelerated (ProRes also accelerated on Apple Silicon)
- Easy lens calibration process
- Fully zero-copy GPU preview rendering
- Core engine is a separate library without external dependencies (no Qt, no ffmpeg, no OpenCV), and can be used to create OpenFX and Adobe plugins (on the TODO list)
- Automatic updates of lens profile database
- Built-in official lens profiles for GoPro HERO 6-13; Sony; DJI; Insta360 action cameras; RunCam: Thumb series, 5 Orange
- Easy management of the video editor plugins from within the app
- Ability to add an additional 3D rotation (useful for framing vertical videos)
