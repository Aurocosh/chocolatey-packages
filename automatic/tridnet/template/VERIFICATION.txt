VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community
in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.

Package can be verified like this:

1. Download zip files from https://mark0.net/soft-tridnet-e.html
   trid_net.zip: https://mark0.net/download/trid_net.zip
   triddefs_xml.7z: https://mark0.net/download/triddefs_xml.7z
   
2. The checksum of the archives should match the following
  TrIDNet {exeVersion}:
  trid_net.zip checksum type: sha256
  trid_net.zip checksum: {exeChecksum}

  Definitions {defsVersion}:
  triddefs_xml.7z checksum type: sha256
  triddefs_xml.7z checksum: {defsChecksum}

3. Unpack contents of both archives into the same folder. 
  Archive trid_net.zip contains the TrIDNet.exe and archive triddefs_xml.7z contains folder 'defs' with the XML definitions required by the TrIDNet.exe to identify file types.

4. To produce the TrIDDefList.TRS file simply launch the program TrIDNet.exe. On startup the program will attempt to load the definitions from the 'defs' folder. 
  If the definition database file TrIDDefList.TRS already exists in the folder with the program, then the program will simply use the existing file.
  If the definition database file TrIDDefList.TRS does not exist in the folder with the program, then the program will load raw XML definitions from the 'defs' folder, process them and create a new TrIDDefList.TRS file. 
  It may take awhile to produce TrIDDefList.TRS from raw definitions, due to the sheer amount of files. There are approximately 20000 definition files in the triddefs_xml.7z archive.

  Validation of the TrIDDefList.TRS with checksum is impossible because TrIDDefList.TRS generated by the TrIDNet.exe from the raw definitions will not be identical every time, even if generated on the same machine.

File 'LICENCE.txt' with license is obtained from the trid_net.zip file. The original 'LICENCE.txt' file name in the trid_net.zip archive is 'readme_tridnet.txt'.

Important note: Links "https://mark0.net/soft-tridnet-e.html" and "https://mark0.net/download/triddefs_xml.7z" are unstable. They will not always point to the same file.
When the new version is released the same url will point to the new version instead of the old one. Only the latest version of the software and XML definitions are available for the download.
